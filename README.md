StartupBrightness.txt <br>
My tasmota bulbs are not always online but connected to a wall switch.<br>
They are hard connected to current when i switch on.<br>
At night i want to start with dimmed light.<br>
Start tasmota lightbulb with specific brightness depending on time of day. <br>

MasterSlave.txt<br>
I use two plugs in master/slave. An amp and a subwoofer are connected.<br>
When the amp is switched on/off, the sub also is switched on/off.<br>
First i had a flood of mqtt messages because on EVERY power change<br>
there was a message! rule1 5 changed that to one message per on/off change.
